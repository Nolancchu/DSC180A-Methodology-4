## Prompts

**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**  
The most interesting topic covered in my domain this quarter was the discussion of how exactly CO2 and Methane affect the atmosphere. Of course, you always here about the fact that they do have serious negative effects, but rarely the specifics of what really goes down.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**  
I want to research whether there is a correlation between human migration patterns and places most closely affected by global warming, to predict future migration as climate effects worsen.

**What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**  
Genuinely, I wish the capstone project was only the only capstone part, no offense, but this main class part does not really add much to the experience besides menial work.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**  
I want to apply more deep learning and neural networks to my current domain, in order to model more complex relationships within the data.
